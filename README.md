# freetype2

Package freetype2 is a minimal wrapper for the FreeType 2 library, with an API
focused around scalable vector fonts.

> FreeType is a software font engine that is designed to be small, efficient,
> highly customizable, and portable while capable of producing high-quality
> output (glyph images). It can be used in graphics libraries, display servers,
> font conversion tools, text image generation tools, and many other products as
> well.
> 
> Note that FreeType is a font service and doesn't provide APIs to perform
> higher-level features like text layout or graphics processing (e.g., colored
> text rendering, ‘hollowing’, etc.). However, it greatly simplifies these tasks
> by providing a simple, easy to use, and uniform interface to access the content
> of font files.
